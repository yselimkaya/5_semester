Real-Time Arbitrage Detection: Layered Heuristic Fast Scanner

This project is an academic and engineering study that combines graph theory and algorithm optimization principles to detect risk-free profit opportunities (arbitrage) in financial currency markets (Forex).
The work proposes and experimentally compares a novel hybrid approach called the Layered Fast Scanner (LFS) to address the latency issue of the standard Bellman-Ford algorithm in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) environments.
